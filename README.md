Key Tasks:
Converted a CSV file to Excel format and organized column widths.
Removed empty rows and duplicates using Filter and Remove Duplicates.
Checked for spelling errors, removed extra whitespace, and adjusted department name columns via Flash Fill.
Ensured the dataset was properly formatted for further analysis.

Part 2: Data Analysis & Visualization
 - Final file: [Montgomery Fleet Inventory Part 2](projects/excel_basics/Montgomery_Fleet_Equipment_Inventory_FA_PART_2_END.XLSX)  
Key Tasks:
Formatted the data as a table and calculated statistics (SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, COUNT) with AutoSum.
Created and sorted Pivot Tables to analyze equipment counts by department and vehicle type.
Employed Slicers for intuitive filtering and interactive data exploration.
Demonstrated advanced PivotTable configurations, including multi-level grouping and collapsing fields.
